### Attach IAM Role to Cloud9 instance

When you provision AWS Cloud9, AWS Cloud9 is configured with only limited permissions. We will attach the IAM role created in **2.1 Creating an IAM Role** to the AWS Cloud9 instance for this Lab.

When Cloud9 is running, you will see the terminal area at the bottom.

Verify your credentials using `aws configure list` command in the AWS Cloud9 terminal

You can see that the *Type* is **shared-credentials-file**. You can see that AWS managed temporary credential with limited permissions was created in `~/.aws/credentials` when AWS Cloud9 was provisioned.

Click the gear icon at the top right of the AWS Cloud9 console to enter the Preferences menu.

**Disable** the **'AWS managed temporary credentialâ€™** option in the **AWS Settings** menu.

Check your credentials using `aws configure list` command that you are using on the AWS Cloud9 workspace.

Attach the IAM Role created in the previous step. Go to the EC2 service page.
**Instances -> Actions -> Security -> Modify IAM role**

To verify the IAM Role is attached to AWS Cloud9 instance, rerun `aws configure list` command to show your credentials. You can see that the value of **Type** is **iam-role**.

Next, install jq:
```bash
sudo yum install -y jq
```

Remove temporary credentials on your workspace.
```bash
rm -vf ${HOME}/.aws/credentials
```

Set the environment variables as follows.
```bash
echo "export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=$(curl -s 169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | jq -r .region)" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export AWS_REGION=\$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

View again your aws credentials using `aws configure list` command.
