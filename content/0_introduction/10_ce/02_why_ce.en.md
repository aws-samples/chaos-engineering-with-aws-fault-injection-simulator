Advances in large-scale, distributed software systems are changing the game for software engineering. As an IT industry, we are quick to adopt practices that increase flexibility and velocity of deployment. An urgent question follows on the heels of these benefits: "How much confidence we can have in the complex systems that we put into production?"

Even when all of the individual services in a distributed system are functioning properly, the interactions between those services can cause unpredictable outcomes. In other words, unpredicable outcomes, compounded by rare but disruptive real-world events that affect production environments, make these distributed systems inherently chaotic.

Therefore, Chaos Engineering can be performed as the following purposes: 

#### Reduce Accident
With Chaos Engineering, you can detect problems before serious problems occur and before customers are affected.

#### Minimize Downtime
Downtime causes large mounts of damage. Losses are even greater during high-traffic events such as sales or launches for internet scale companies. You can read more details in [here](https://www.gremlin.com/blog/the-cost-of-downtime/). 

#### Strength Ability
Building your team's capability to overcome failure is very important. Chaos Engineering enables engineers to train how to respond to incidents.

#### Prepare Failure
Chaos engineering enables your team to build reliable and fault-tolerant applications and systems with confidence. And they can create more value by reducing response time to failures.
