# EKS

[Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is a fully managed Kubernetes service. Amazon EKS gives you the flexibility to start, run, and scale Kubernetes applications in the AWS Cloud or on-premises. Amazon EKS helps you provide highly available and secure clusters and automates key tasks such as patching, node provisioning, and updates. AWS Users trust EKS to run their most sensitive and mission-critical applications because of its security, reliability, and scalability.

[AWS Fault Injection Simulator](https://aws.amazon.com/fis/) is a fully managed service for running fault injection experiments on AWS that makes it easier to improve an applicationâ€™s performance, observability, and resiliency. Fault injection experiments are used in chaos engineering, which is the practice of stressing an application in testing or production environments by creating disruptive events, such as sudden increase in CPU or memory consumption, observing how the system responds, and implementing improvements.

In this module, we will run various chaos engineering experiments using Amazon EKS, AWS FIS, and other tools. Move to the next.
