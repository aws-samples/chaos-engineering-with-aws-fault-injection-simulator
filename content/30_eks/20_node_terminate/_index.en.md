# Terminate EKS Nodes

AWS FIS allows you to test resilience of EKS cluster node groups. See what happens if you shut down some ec2 nodes for kubernetes pods or services within a certain percentage. This test verifies that the EKS managed node group launches new instances to meet the defined desired capacity and ensures that the application containers continues to run well. Also, this test will help you understand what happens to your application when you upgrade your cluster. At this time, in order to satisfy both resiliency and ease of cluster upgrade, the container should be designed so that it can be moved easily. This makes it easy to move containers running on the failed node to another node to continue working. This is an important part of a cloud-native architecture.
